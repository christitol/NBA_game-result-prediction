## General info
This project is part of MSc in AI for ML course. Purpose is to predict win or loss for an NBA game

## Data pre-processing
Data are retrieved from the nba-api and processed in a reasonable way for modeling. Also feature engineering was performed in order to create features that could give good predictability
	
## Classifiers

In order to predict the result an SVM, Decision tree and Random forest model was trained.
